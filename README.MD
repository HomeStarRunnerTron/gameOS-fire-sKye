## gameOS - Fire theme variant for Pegasus Frontend

Theme fork based on the gameOS theme by Seth Powell ([PlayingKarrde](https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/gameOS))
The Fire version is a recoloured version of Seth's theme.
The colour palette has been inspired by the Fire TV UI colours.

## Installation

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/jimbob4000/gameOS/releases/latest) and extract it in your [Pegasus theme directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes/) under a folder called gameOS-Fire.

Windows users may need to install the [K-lite Codec Pack](https://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) to get video playback working.

IMPORTANT: You need to have the latest version of Pegasus installed (not the current Stable release) otherwise you will get an error regarding Qt.Modules.
